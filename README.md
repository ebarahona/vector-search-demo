# MongoDB Atlas Vector Search Demo
This demo is based on the blogpost from [Benjamin Flask](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/semantic-search-mongodb-atlas-vector-search/)

You can follow the instructions in this blogpost to create the backend on MongoDB Atlas and then you can use the React client out of this Project to play around with the Vector Search.

For the React client just change the App-ID on line 11 in the index.js file and set the endpoint URL on line 17 in the same file to your own backend url which Atlas will present you on the GraphQL tab in the App Services.

Then execute npm start to start your client.
